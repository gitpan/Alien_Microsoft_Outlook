=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module contains code abstracted from Mail::Outlook. It will not install (without force)
unless Microsoft Outlook can be detected.

It does the detection by using Win32::OLE::Const to load "Microsoft Outlook" and then checking
that the constants olFolderInbox, olFolderOutbox, olFolderSentMail, olFolderDrafts, olFolderDeletedItems,
and olMailItem are all defined.

It does not attempt to install Microsoft::Outlook.
